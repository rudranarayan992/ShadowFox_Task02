# 🦊 **ShadowFox_02** - Python Numbers & Calculations

Welcome to **ShadowFox_02**, part of my **Python learning journey**! In this repository, I tackle **Task 02** of my **ShadowFox** project, focusing on real-world calculations using Python.

## 📘 **What I Learned:**
- **🎯 Formatting with `format()`**: Converting numbers into different representations (e.g., octal format).
- **📏 Circle Area Calculation**: Using the formula **π × r²** to calculate the area of a circular pond.
- **💧 Water Volume Calculation**: Determining the total water volume in the pond, based on a density of 1.4 liters per square meter.
- **🚶 Speed Calculation**: Finding the speed (in meters per second) when crossing a street, using basic physics formulas.

## 🛠️ **Files in This Repo:**
- **`Task_2.py`**: The main Python script where I implemented the calculations and formatting.

## 🧑‍💻 **Key Concepts Covered:**
- **Mathematical Operations in Python**
- **Type Conversion (`int()` and `float()`)**
- **Problem-Solving Using Python**

## 🌟 **Highlights:**
- **Python's `format()` function** to convert numbers to their octal representation
- **Real-world problem-solving** like speed and water volume calculations
- **Increased confidence in working with math and Python** to solve practical tasks

## 🔮 **Future Tasks:**
- More **Python projects** focused on advanced problem-solving, automation, and security-related challenges.
